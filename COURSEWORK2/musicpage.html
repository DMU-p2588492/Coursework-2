I gotta say, its one of the best tracks on the new album but it sometimes feel they already reached their peak on 2016/17 and are just running extra laps now.'

Unlike alot of albums that have effects in them that are generally hit-and-miss, everything in it sounded like it fit in exactly the way that Waters, Gilmour and company wanted it to. Keeping that in mind, it should be no suprise Im a fan of the hit single it spawne'

Although this is normal capitalistic measures, I find it hugely ironic that they chose the song as the single, a song whose concept revolves around greed. To promote anti-greed, they need to be greedy.'

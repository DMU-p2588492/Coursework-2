    <h2 class="AboutSubheading">About</h2>
    <p class="AboutParagraph">Suicideboys (stylized as $uicideboy$) are an American hip hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and Scrim (stylized as $crim). Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is distributed by Virgin Music Label & Artist Services. The duo are considered one of the most popular acts in the underground rap scene, and are also considered to have a cult following After several years of solely releasing EPs and mixtapes, </p>
    <h2 class="HistorySubheading">History</h2>
    <p class="HistoryParagraph">Even though they combined their talents in 2014, the pair were already well-acquainted as cousins. Ruby da Cherry and Scrim grew up together, white kids in Black neighborhoods on the east and west banks of the Crescent City. However, they initially veered down different paths. Ruby (aka Suicide Leopard) dabbled in punk rock, influenced by the Misfits, Minor Threat, and Leftover Crack. Meanwhile, Scrim (aka $lick $loth and Suicide Christ) was a DJ and songwriter. Once they joined forces, the result was a dark blend of horrorcore glitch-trap bubbling with booming bass, ominous atmospherics, and occultish, drugged-out rhymes. Signed to G59 Records, the Boy$ released the ambitious ten-part series Kill Your$elf. With titles like The $uicide $aga, The $eppuku $aga, and Re$urrection, $uicideboy$ layered their twisted raps over short tracks, releasing additional EPs like Black $uicide (with Black Smurf), Grey Sheep, G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S., and My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Can't in 2015.</p>
